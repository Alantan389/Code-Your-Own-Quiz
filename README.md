# Code-Your-Own-Quiz
### Built a fill-in-the blanks type quiz to leverage the power of functions in Python and mastered the ability to automate repetitive tasks that can be done on a computer.


You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean. 
Now you'll work on your own game to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.





Number Game :

Create a different version of the program that:

Takes a 3-digit number and generates a 6-digit number with the 3-digit number repeated, for example, 391 becomes 391391. The rule is to multiply the 3-digit number by 7*11*13.
Takes a 5-digit number and generates a 10-digit number with the 5-digit number repeated, for example, 49522 becomes 4952249522. The rule is to multiply the 5-digit number by 11*9091.
Times 11: A two-digit number can be easily multiplied by 11 in one's head simply by adding the digits and inserting that sum between the digits. For example, 43 * 11 has the resulting digits of 4, 4+3, and 3, yielding 473. If the sum between the digits is greater than 9, then the 1 is carried to the hundreds place. Complete the below program




--------------------------------------------------------------



Expression for calories burned during workout
The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print('Calories: {:.2f} calories'.format(calories))





Variables, input, and type conversion
(1) Prompt the user to input an integer between 32 and 126, a float, a character, and a string, storing each into separate variables. Then, output those four values on a single line separated by a space. (Submit for 2 points).

Note: This zyLab outputs a newline after each user-input prompt. For convenience in the examples below, the user's input value is shown on the next line, but such values don't actually appear as output when the program runs.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

creating passwords


separated by a space. (Submit for 1 point)

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6
the output after the prompts is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6
Note: User input is not part of the program output.


(2) Output two passwords using a combination of the user input. Format the passwords as shown below. (Submit for 2 points, so 3 points total).

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6
the output after the prompts is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

First password: yellow_Daisy
Second password: 6yellow6

(3) Output the length of each password (the number of characters in the strings). (Submit for 2 points, so 5 points total).

Ex: If the input is:

yellow
Daisy
6
the output after the prompts is:

You entered: yellow Daisy 6

First password: yellow_Daisy
Second password: 6yellow6

Number of characters in yellow_Daisy: 12
Number of characters in 6yellow6: 8

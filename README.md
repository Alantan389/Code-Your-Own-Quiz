# Code-Your-Own-Quiz
### Built a fill-in-the blanks type quiz to leverage the power of functions in Python and mastered the ability to automate repetitive tasks that can be done on a computer.


You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean. 
Now you'll work on your own game to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.





Number Game :

Create a different version of the program that:

Takes a 3-digit number and generates a 6-digit number with the 3-digit number repeated, for example, 391 becomes 391391. The rule is to multiply the 3-digit number by 7*11*13.
Takes a 5-digit number and generates a 10-digit number with the 5-digit number repeated, for example, 49522 becomes 4952249522. The rule is to multiply the 5-digit number by 11*9091.
Times 11: A two-digit number can be easily multiplied by 11 in one's head simply by adding the digits and inserting that sum between the digits. For example, 43 * 11 has the resulting digits of 4, 4+3, and 3, yielding 473. If the sum between the digits is greater than 9, then the 1 is carried to the hundreds place. Complete the below program
